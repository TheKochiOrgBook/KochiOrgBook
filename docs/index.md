# Overview

KochiOrgBook(KOB) is a [Digital Trust Ecosystem](./gf_controlled/glossary.md#digital-trust-ecosystem) project for the city of Kochi. 

KOB includes a [Decentralised Identity(DID)](gf_controlled/glossary.md#did--decentralized-identifier) based [Public Identity Utiltity(KOBPIU)](gf_info/sub_projects.md#kochiorgbook-public-identity-utility-kobpiu) network, a [Verifiable Organisations Network(KOBVON)](gf_info/sub_projects.md#kobvon) for the associations in Kochi, an [Association Wallet(KOBAW)](./gf_info/sub_projects.md#kochiorgbook-association-wallet-kobaw), a DID based [Mobile Wallet application(KOBConnect)](gf_info/sub_projects.md#kobconnect) and a [Community Cloud(KOBCC)](gf_info/sub_projects.md#kochiorgbook-community-cloud-kobcc). 

KOB is a technology demonstrator to launch a DID based public identity utility compliant with the ToIP standards to enable Trusted digital verification service for various association within the city of Kochi.​

The objective of this initiative is to create a Digital Trust Ecosystem for the citizens, associations and digital service providers in the city of Kochi by setting up a KOB Consortia and enabling any Association, having it's presence in the city of Kochi, to register on the [KOBVON](gf_info/sub_projects.md#kobvon) Network to issue digital proofs and host a Verifiable Credential Registry(VCR) in a transparent and cost efficient manner. 

In the current form it may not be feasible for an ordinary citizen to confirm if these association are valid or not due to chance of forgery of documents and we often trust the documents they present making it quite easy to misguide anyone.

With KochiOrgBook each association will now be able to present cryptographically encrypted digital credentials which has been issued to them from a trusted entity and can be verified by any citizen of Kochi using their mobile [wallet app](./glossary.md#agents-and-wallets).

In the current sceanrio, for a citizen to avail any service or to prove their eligibility or identity, they have to provide a number of documents. Often the whole process takes time and a lot of effort.

This utility aims to cut down the red tape and improve the overall efficiency of the current processes.



## Mission

Internet scale digital trust with close to 1 million digital credentials on the network.​
