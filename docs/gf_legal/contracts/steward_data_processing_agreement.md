# Steward Data Processing Agreement V1

This Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) supplements the KOBPIU Steward Agreement (“KSA”) between the KOB Foundation and Steward, as may be amended from time to time, and is hereby incorporated by reference into the KSA. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this DPA will have the meaning given to them in the KSA or in the KOBPIU Governance Framework. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between this DPA and the KSA, this DPA will govern. This DPA will survive termination of the KSA as long as Steward Processes Personal Data. The KOB Foundation and Steward agree as follows:

**1. Definitions.**

1. “GDPR” means the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, and any amendment or replacement to it.

2. “Impermissible Personal Data” means the Personal Data that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger and that a Steward Processes that is not Permissible Personal Data in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement.

3. “Permissible Personal Data” means the Personal Data expressly listed in Schedule 1 that a Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in accordance with the Transaction Author Agreement and that a Steward Processes through the Steward Node.

4. “Personal Data” means information that relates, directly or indirectly, to a data subject, including without limitation, names, email addresses, postal addresses, identification numbers, location data, online identifiers, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of the data subject.

5. “Process” or “Processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on Node Data, whether or not by automated means, such as the access, collection, use, storage, disclosure, dissemination, combination, recording, organization, structuring, adaption, alteration, copying, transfer, retrieval, consultation, disposal, restriction, erasure and/or destruction of Node Data.

6. “Node Data” means any information which includes any Personal Data that Steward Processes through the Steward Node.

7. “Security Breach” means any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, any Node Data or otherwise affecting Steward’s operation of the Steward Node in compliance with this DPA.

8. “KOBPIU Governance Framework” means the KOB Foundation’s governance policies and rules available [here](../../gf_info/master_doc.md). **(check again)**

9.  “Standard Contractual Clauses” means the standard contractual clauses, as agreed by the European Commission, for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection as set out in Commission  Decision C(2010) 593, as updated, amended replaced or superseded from time to time by the European Commission. **(Check again)**

10. “Subprocessor” means any processor engaged by Steward who will access or receive Personal Data from Steward for Processing.

The terms “controller”, “data subject”, “personal data”, “processor”, and “supervisory authority” as used in this DPA will have the meanings ascribed to them in the GDPR.

**2. Purpose of Processing Personal Data.** In connection with performing its services obligations under the KSA (the “Services”) Steward may Process Node Data in accordance with this DPA. Specific details of the Processing activities including categories and type of Node Data that Steward will Process in connection with the KSA are set forth in Schedule 1 (Scope of Processing).

**3. Processor and Controller Responsibilities.**

1. The KOB Foundation and Steward agree that the KOB Foundation is the legal entity that serves as the designated data controller for Personal Data written to the KOBPIU Ledger for the purpose of making decisions relating to the architecture, operation and governance of the KOBPIU Network and being the point of contact as explained in Section 3(c) below. Therefore, the parties acknowledge and agree that: (a) Steward is a processor of Node Data under the GDPR and (b) the KOB Foundation is the designated controller of Node Data under the GDPR and will be responsible for the lawfulness of the Processing of such data in compliance with the GDPR and other data privacy laws applicable to it as data controller.

2. Transaction Authors are independent controllers of any Personal Data they write to the KOBPIU Ledger. Transaction Authors and the KOB Foundation independently determine the purposes and means of Processing Personal Data. In no event will Transaction Authors be deemed joint controllers with the KOB Foundation under Article 26 of the GDPR or deemed to jointly determine and control the purposes and means of Processing Personal Data. The KOB Foundation will provide the list of all other controllers (i.e., Transaction Authors) on behalf of which the Steward Processes Personal Data through the KOBPIU Ledger by referring Stewards to information available on the KOBPIU Ledger.

3. As an accommodation to Steward, the KOB Foundation shall serve as the administrative coordinator for a Transaction Author’s exercise of its rights and performance of its obligations under the GDPR by serving as a single point of contact for Steward and by obtaining all necessary permissions from the other controllers (i.e., Transaction Authors) for the Processing of the Node Data. Steward shall be discharged of its obligation to inform or notify another Controller when it has provided such information or notice required under the GDPR to the KOB Foundation. Similarly, Steward will serve as a single point of contact for KOB Foundation with respect to its obligations as a processor under this DPA.However, in no event will the KOB Foundation be held liable for the actions or omissions of any Transaction Author arising out of any Personal Data that such Transaction Author writes to the KOBPIU Ledger in breach of the Transaction Author Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, including but not limited to any Impermissible Personal Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Transaction Author writes Permissible Personal Data to the KOBPIU Ledger in express compliance with the Transaction Author Agreement and the KOBPIU Governance Framework, the KOB Foundation is responsible for the lawfulness of such Processing once such Permissible Personal Data is written to the KOBPIU Ledger.

**4. Steward Responsibilities.** Steward will:

1. Process Node Data only in accordance with the KOBPIU Governance Framework and other lawful documented instructions (“Additional Instruction”) from the KOB Foundation. If Steward notifies KOB Foundation that such other instruction is not feasible, the parties shall work together to find an alternative. If neither the Additional Instruction nor an alternative is feasible, the KOB Foundation may terminate the affected Services pursuant to the SSA. Steward will inform the KOB Foundation if it is aware or reasonably suspects that the KOB Foundation’s instructions regarding the Processing of Node Data may breach the GDPR and may suspend the performance of such instruction until the KOB Foundation has modified the instruction or confirmed its lawfulness in documented form;

2. ensure that persons authorized to Process the Node Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality even if such Node Data is public or already in the possession of Steward;

3. promptly notify and reasonably assist the KOB Foundation, if it receives a request from a data subject for access to, correction, amendment, deletion of or objection to the Processing of Node Data relating to such individual;

4. assist the KOB Foundation, at the KOB Foundation’s request, in complying with the KOB Foundation’s obligations to respond to data subject requests and its compliance regarding Node Data Processed by Steward, to the extent technically feasible given the architecture of the KOBPIU Network taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Steward;

5. at the direction of the KOB Foundation, cooperate and assist the KOB Foundation in conducting a data protection impact assessment and related consultations with any supervisory authority; and

6. comply with the GDPR and other data privacy laws applicable to Steward as a processor in Processing the Node Data and in the performance of the Services.

**5. Subprocessors.** The KOB Foundation generally authorizes the use of Subprocessors to Process
Node Data in connection with fulfilling Steward’s obligations under the SSA and/or this DPA;
provided that such Subprocessors meet the requirements set forth in the KOBPIU Governance
Framework. Steward will remain fully responsible for fulfilment of its obligations under this DPA and
will remain the primary point of contact regarding any Processing of Node Data. Steward will be
responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors and anyone else to which the Processing
of Node Data or operation of the Node has been delegated by it. Steward will impose contractual
obligations on its Subprocessors that are at least equivalent to those obligations imposed on
Steward under this DPA. Upon KOB Foundation’s request, KOB Foundation has the right to
review and recommend changes to the relevant subprocessing contract between Steward and its
Subprocessors, and Steward will reasonably comply with such request. Steward will notify the KOBPIU
Foundation in writing (email acceptable) of any proposed changes to its Subprocessors and give the
KOB Foundation the opportunity to object to such changes. Within thirty (30) days after Steward
notifies the KOB Foundation of the intended change, the KOB Foundation can object to the
addition of a Subprocessor on the basis that such addition would cause the KOB Foundation to
violate the GDPR or other applicable privacy laws. Such objection shall be in writing and include
specific reasons for its objection and reasonable options to mitigate, if any. If the KOB Foundation
does not object within such period, the respective Subprocessor will be permitted to Process Node
Data. If the KOB Foundation objects to the addition of a Subprocessor in accordance with this
Section 5 and Steward cannot reasonably accommodate such objection, Steward will promptly
notify it in writing stating in reasonable detail the reason for such inability to accommodate such
objection. In such event, the parties shall cooperate in good faith to find a feasible workaround;
provided that, if the parties are unable to find a feasible workaround within thirty (30) days of
Steward’s notice, then the KOB Foundation may terminate the affected Services as set out in the
SSA without any liability to Steward.

**6. Data Transfers.** For all Stewards not based in the European Economic Area (EEA), by signing this
DPA, each party is deemed to have signed the Standard Contractual Clauses, attached hereto as
Schedule 2, with the KOB Foundation, on its own and on behalf of the respective Transaction
Authors, as the “Data Exporter” and Steward as the “Data Importer” (as each of these terms is
defined in the Standard Contractual Clauses). If a Subprocessor of Steward is a Data Importer,
Steward agrees that it will enter into the EU controller to non-EU or EEA processor Standard
Contractual Clauses on behalf of such Subprocessor if it is an affiliate of Steward, otherwise Steward
will enter into a written agreement imposing obligations on such Subprocessor at least as stringent
as those imposed on Steward in accordance with Clause 11 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.

**7. Security Safeguards.** Steward will implement, maintain and monitor a comprehensive written
information security policy that contains appropriate technical and organizational measures (the
“Steward TOMs”) to protect the security and confidentiality of Node Data. The Steward TOMs will
be appropriate to the Node Data that Steward Processes and will meet the requirements set forth in
Article 32 of the GDPR, the SSA and the KOBPIU Governance Framework. The Steward TOMs will meet
the standards in Appendix 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses attached hereto and the Steward
Technical and Organizational Policies as set forth in the KOBPIU Governance Framework (the
“Steward TOPs”). The parties agree the Steward TOPS satisfy the requirements of this Section 7. The
KOB Foundation may update the Steward TOPs pursuant to the KOBPIU Governance Framework in
light of the development and progression of technology. Such updates will be communicated to
Steward via electronic communication and/or notification on the KOB Foundation website.
Accordingly, Steward reserves the right to implement Steward TOMs that exceed the requirements
of the Steward TOPs; provided that the functionality and security of the Services are not degraded.

**8. Audits.** Upon reasonable notice to Steward, the KOB Foundation may conduct or may engage an
independent third party which shall not be a direct competitor of Steward and shall be bound to
obligations of confidentiality (“Auditor”) to conduct an information security audit of Steward to
meet its audit requirements under Article 28 of the GDPR and its obligations under Articles 32 to 36
of the GDPR. Prior to commencement of the audit, the parties will agree in writing to the terms and
conditions governing the conduct of the audit. Steward will reasonably cooperate with the KOBPIU
Foundation and/or its Auditor in conducting such audit; provided that, nothing in this DPA will
require Steward to provide information to the KOB Foundation that is publicly available on the
KOBPIU Ledger. KOB Foundation agrees to reimburse reasonable and documented expenses
incurred by Steward related to any information security audit initiated by KOB Foundation.

**9. Security Breach.** Without undue delay after becoming aware, Steward will notify the KOBPIU
Foundation in writing of any actual Security Breach. Steward will promptly investigate any Security
Breach and is obligated to expend no more than an amount mutually agreed between KOBPIU
Foundation and Steward. Any additional amount of required expenditure will be the obligation of
KOB Foundation consistent with Section 13 below. Steward will provide the KOB Foundation
with reasonable assistance to satisfy any legal obligations of the KOB Foundation in relation to
such Security Breach (including any obligation to notify data protection authorities or data subjects).
In the event of a Security Breach, the KOB Foundation has the right to control the breach
notification process, unless the GDPR dictates otherwise.

**10. Return or Destruction of Node Data.** Upon termination or expiration of the SSA and to the extent
technically feasible given the architecture of the KOBPIU Network, Steward will return to the KOBPIU
Foundation or destroy all Node Data and all copies thereof in its possession or under its control as
specified in the Steward TOPs, except to the extent that Steward is required under the GDPR to keep
a copy of the Node Data.

**11. Records.** In addition to the record provided by the KOBPIU Ledger, Steward will keep at its normal
place of business all information relating to Steward’s Processing of Node Data as described in the
Steward TOPs and in this DPA pursuant to Article 28(h) of the GDPR. Steward will make such
documents and all other information necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations in
Article 28(h) of the GDPR available to the KOB Foundation upon request.

**12. Limitation of Liability.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the SSA, a party’s liability for
breach of its obligations including any claims arising from this DPA or the Standard Contractual
Clauses, will be limited as set forth below.

1. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER THIS DPA,INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY IS EXPRESSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA EXCEED $250,000 USD IN THE AGGREGATE. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, SUCH PARTY’S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA SHALL NOT EXCEED $500,000 USD IN THE AGGREGATE. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER PARTY’S WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, THERE SHALL BE NO DOLLAR CAP ON SUCH PARTY’S LIABILITY UNDER THIS DPA. **(Check the figures again)**

2. However, in the event of any conflict between the Standard Contractual Clauses and this Section 12, the Standard Contractual Clauses will prevail but only with respect to claims arising from the Standard Contractual Clauses.

3. As the KOB Foundation is entering into this DPA on behalf of itself and the Transaction Authors, the KOB Foundation will secure a Transaction Author’s consent to the limitation of liability set forth in this Section 12 through the Transaction Author Agreement. Therefore a Transaction Author will be considered a “party” as used in this Section 12 for the purpose of interpreting this limitation of liability.

4. Without prejudice to Art. 82 of GDPR and for the avoidance of doubt, no controller will be jointly and severally liable with any other controller to Steward or vice versa.

**13. Assistance:** The KOB Foundation will make a written request to Steward for any assistance
referred to in this DPA. Steward and the KOB Foundation will mutually agree in writing to a
reasonable charge for Steward to perform such assistance or an Additional Instruction. If the parties
do not mutually agree to such reasonable charge, the parties agree to reasonably cooperate to find
a feasible solution.

**14. Disputes.** The parties will make good faith efforts to first resolve internally any dispute under this
DPA. Neither party will seek any external remedies until thirty (30) days have elapsed from the
initiation of such good faith efforts. At the conclusion of any such thirty (30) day period, each party
shall be entitled as a matter of right to seek remedies for any dispute, controversy, or claim arising
out of, relating to, involving, or having any connection with this DPA, including any question
regarding the validity, interpretation, scope, performance, or enforceability of this dispute
resolution provision, in any court of competent jurisdiction, in equity or otherwise. The rights
conferred upon the parties by the preceding sentence shall not be exclusive of any other rights or
remedies which each party may have at law, in equity or otherwise.





The Parties hereto have caused this DPA to be executed by their duly authorized representatives
as of the Effective Date.
