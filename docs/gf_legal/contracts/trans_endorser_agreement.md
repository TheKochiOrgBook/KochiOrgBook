Arbitration proceedings will be held in London, England. Unless the Parties otherwise mutually agree, such arbitration shall be conducted in the English language by electronic exchange of documents and by video conference. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law. The arbitrator shall require exchange by the Parties of documents relevant to the issues raised by any claim, defense, or counterclaim or on which the producing Party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim, defense, or counterclaim, with due regard for eliminating undue burden and expense and the expedited and lower cost nature of arbitration.
